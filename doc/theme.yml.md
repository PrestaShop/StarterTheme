# Theme configuration file

In order to be activated, this theme needs to be configured with a `theme.yml` file in `config/` folder.
Several files will be checked by the **Theme Manager** to validate the theme's integrity.
 
## Mandatory Structure Requirements

A theme must consist of the following file structure before it can be installed:

| Localization        | Description           |
|:--------------------|-----------------------| 
| -                   | preview.png           |

| assets/js           | theme.js              |
| assets/css          | theme.css             |
| templates           | page.tpl              |
